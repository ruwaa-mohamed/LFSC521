### Downloading Sample Data

For the purpose of only trying the `tidyverse` R package, sample data of **PheWAS of GWAS Catalog of SNPs** was downloaded from **eMERGE** databases. The downloaded data can be found here: 

<https://phewascatalog.org/files/phewas-catalog.csv.zip>. 

The downloaded file was unzipped to get the CSV file.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

### Load the Data

```{r}
df <- read.csv("phewas-catalog.csv")
head(df)
```

```{r}
colnames(df)
```

### Data Analysis

```{r}
str(df)
```
